* redox meets dao-choc-ble and friends

** Idea:
Mix the best parts from nice keyboards:

*** MCU
*Take the electronics from dao-choc-ble:*
The [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yumagulovrn/dao-choc-ble/][yumagulovrn/dao-choc-ble]] (which itself took inspiration from the electrical circuit of [[https://github.com/MangoIV/le_chiff_ble][MangoIV/le_chiff_ble]]) uses the MINEW MS88SF2 BLE module.
**** Alternatives for MCU:
- pro-mirco footprint
- xiao footprint with IO expander, similar to [[https://gitlab.com/lpgalaxy/revxlp][revxlp]]
- nRF52850-Dongle, with usb-c breakout board inspired by [[https://github.com/Pekaso/fortitude60/blob/master/Documents/buildguide_en_v1.1.md][fortitude60]]
*** Layout
- The number of Keys from Redox
- The pinky stagger from the Kyria

Other potential random ideas:
- Multi layered, similar to pinky4?

** Plan:
- Use [[https://zmk.dev/][ZMK]]
- Use KiCad
- Fully open source
- ...
